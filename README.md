**tl;dr: The last stable version of filtr can be found at http://aaronland.info/bin/filtr/**

If you're reading this it means that the next version of filtr is still lying on
the floor in a million pieces. I neglected to make a separate branch when I
started and now there's just stuff all over the place. Sorry about that.

Basically I am trying to take the original filtr application and make it a bit
more modular and easier to add new recipes to. That work is still happening
which means things (in this repo) work... until they don't.
