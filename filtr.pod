=head1 FILTERS

=head2 dazd

 $> filtr infile.jpg outfile.jpg dazd

=head2 filtr

 $> filtr infile.jpg outfile.jpg filtr

=head2 heathr

 $> filtr infile1.jpg infile2.jpg heathr name-o-infile1-filtr name-o-infile2-filtr outfile.jpg

This filter will modify infile1.jpg and infile2.jpg. That's not really a feature.

=head2 postr

 $> filtr infile.jpg outfile.jpg postr

=head2 stndpipe

 $> filtr infile1.jpg infile2.jpg stndpipe name-o-infile1-filtr name-o-infile2-filtr outfile.jpg

This filter will modify infile1.jpg and infile2.jpg. That's not really a feature.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over 4

=item * B<ImageMagick>

All of these filters were written using ImageMagick 5.x I tried installing IM 6
once and all hell broke loose. Dunno.

On FreeBSD, my experience has been that you'll need to install GraphicsMagick to
prevent core dumpage. 

=item * B<python>

Not really an option but the good news is that Python is (generally) easier to get
installed on oddball devices (stuff like Nokia's maemo/internet tablets) than apps
like I<jhead> and surprisingly I<md5sum>.

=item * B<ffmpeg>

This is only necessary for movr.

=item * B<perl>

This is only necessary for movr, but if you can get ffmpeg installed Perl is the
least of your worries...

Patch and test to run under Linux. This probably just means testing the paths
and arguments passed to any one command.

=item 

Documentation.

=item 

Replace feeping Perl-isms with plain old awk.

=item 

Figure out how to DWIM when unlinking pre-exising ${OUTPUT} when calling
'heathr' or 'stndpipe'

=item 

Make reporting better. Reporting? Exactly.

=item 

Try to rationalize input parameters? Hahahaha.
